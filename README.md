# dumperjumper
Dumperjumper is a jump type web game that is mostly trash. Avaliable for anyone trashy enough at [dumperjumper.com](dumperjumper.com)

Is it better than other jump type games? Considering they are all trash it's at least the most honest.

Intended as a simple project to practice a static interactive website with .js, .css, .html, image artifacts and deployment using Github Actions and AWS services: S3 for hosting, Cloudfront for CDN, and Route 53 for DNS. Playable in web browser on iPhone or Desktop.
