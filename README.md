# dumperjumper
Dumperjumper is a jump type web game that is mostly trash. Avaliable for anyone trashy enough at [dumperjumper.com](https://dumperjumper.com/)

Intended as a simple project to practice a static interactive website with .js, .css, .html, image artifacts and deployment using Github Actions and AWS services: S3 for hosting, Cloudfront for CDN, and Route 53 for DNS. Usage of Terraform to maintain AWS infrastructure.
Is it better than other jump type games? Considering they are all trash it's at least the most honest. Playable in web browser on mobile or desktop.
